Prevention is known to be the cornerstone to lessen the incidence of CVDs and also to reduce the economic burden of both the citizen and the healthcare system. \"Interventional medicine\" certainly puts lifestyle modification as the first therapeutic step, including a healthy diet and physical activity. Secondly, a large body of research individuated a number of food and plant bioactives, which are potentially efficacious in preventing and reducing some highly prevalent CV risk factors, such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, vascular inflammation and vascular compliance. Some lipid- and blood pressure-lowering bioactives were studied for their impact on human vascular health, particularly as regards endothelial function and arterial stiffness. Several nutraceuticals showed additive or synergistic properties in combination, sometimes (but not always) allowing a reduction of the administered dose of extracts and determining a \"multi-factorial\" final effect on many cardiovascular risk factors. Thus, this review focuses on available evidence regarding the effects of berberine, plant sterols, green tea extract, soy, curcumin, cocoa, pycnogenol, lycopene, olive oil, soluble fibers, garlic, resveratrol, beetroot, mineral salts and vitamins on the lipid profile, blood pressure, inflammatory and endothelial markers, and vascular compliance. Future clinical research studies will have to focus more on middle term modification of the instrumental markers of vascular aging than on short-term effects on indirect laboratory risk markers.",

        "rek_description": "Hypercholesterolemia is one of the major risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease. Atherosclerosis resulting from hypercholesterolemia causes many serious cardiovascular diseases. Statins are generally accepted as a treatment of choice for lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, which reduces coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality. Since statin use can be associated with muscle problems and other adverse symptoms, non-adherence and discontinuation of statin therapy often leads to inadequate control of plasma cholesterol levels and increased cardiovascular risk. Moreover, there is compelling evidence on the presence of still considerable residual cardiovascular risk in statin-treated patients. Ezetimibe improves cholesterol-lowering efficacy and provides mild additional cardiovascular protection when combined with statin treatment. Despite a favorable safety profile compared to statins, ezetimibe-induced cholesterol-lowering is modest when used alone. Hence, there is a critical need to identity additional effective hypolipidemic agents that can be used either in combination with statins, or alone, if statins are not tolerated. Thus, hypolipidemic agents such as proprotein convertase subtilisin\/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, apolipoprotein B-100 antisense oligonucleotides, cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors, and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) inhibitors, as well as yeast polysaccharides (beta-glucans and mannans) and compounds derived from natural sources (nutraceuticals) such as glucomannans, plant sterols, berberine, and red yeast rice are being used. In this review, we will discuss hypercholesterolemia, its impact on the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and the use of yeast polysaccharides, various nutraceuticals, and several therapeutic agents not derived from 'natural' sources, to treat hypercholesterolemia.",

        "rek_description": "Several risk factors such as abnormality of lipid metabolism (e.g. high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), elevated triglycerides and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)) play a central role in the aetiology of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Nutraceutical combination together with a cholesterol-lowering action, when associated with suitable lifestyle, should furnish an alternative to pharmacotherapy in patients reporting statin-intolerance and in subjects at low cardiovascular risk. The present review is focused on nutraceuticals and their synergetic combinations demonstrating a beneficial effect in the management of dyslipidaemia. Several nutraceuticals have been shown to positively modulate lipid metabolism having different functions. Plant sterols and soluble fibres can, for example, decrease the intestinal assimilation of lipids and increase their elimination. Furthermore, berberine and soybean proteins improve the cholesterol uptake in the liver. Policosanols, monacolins and bergamot inhibit hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCoA reductase) enzyme action determining the cholesterol hepatic synthesis. Moreover, pomegranate can decrease LDL oxidation and positively affect subclinical atherosclerosis; red yeast rice and berberine play, instead, an important role on endothelial dysfunction and psyllium, plant sterols and bergamot have positive effects on LDL subclasses. To the best of our knowledge, there are no long-term large-scale studies on the anti-atherogenic effect of the nutraceuticals that are available on the market. Thus, further clinical studies should investigate in order to achieve long term tolerability and safety and to provide a better nutraceutical combination tailored to the patient needs.",
