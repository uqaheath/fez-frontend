                            "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This study explores the way people feel about our present society and seeks indications of their preferences for the future.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A central theme is the ubiquity of technology in an \'advanced\' society. The study began with consideration of the likely effects of new technology, but branched out to encompass related social issues such as standard of living, consumption of non-renewable resources, pollution, unemployment, decision-making and stress.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an empirical study for which the data collection involved a personal briefing of participants by the researcher and their subsequent response by completion of written documents.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The study examines the responses of 225 people in five social or work groups in the Brisbane metropolitan area. Respondents were asked to perform two tasks:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. To rank-order sixteen possible scenarios for Australian society in the decade 1980-1990.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. To answer a twenty-point questionnaire on related issues.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sixteen scenarios were devised by using a quarter-factorial design to combine the six factors noted above. The responses were analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS).<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The study indicates the choices and trade-offs that people make in selecting social environments which they deem satisfactory. It also reveals attitudes to a wide range of social issues, including unemployment, pollution, education and politically-related topics such as strikes, compulsory unionism and nuclear power.<br />"

                            "This report in an industry study of the Australian Fast Foods and Snack Food Industries. The objective is to examine the history of these industries in Australia, discussing their evolution, and factors such as:<br />-market size<br />-level and types of competition<br />-market growth<br />-ownership<br />-industry structures<br /><br />The fast foods and snacks foods industries are treated separately in Parts 1&amp;2, as each industry has a distinct history and evolution. In Part 3, competitive strategies are discussed, outlining any common areas for both industries and also any divergent issues. The reasons for the commonality or divergence are shown, as both industries are a subset of the much larger overall &ldquo;Food Industry&rdquo;. <br /><br />The opportunities for expansion in each industry are discussed, against the threats which may inhibit their industries&rsquo; growths. The report concentrates on the large operators in the fast foods segment such as McDonald&rsquo;s, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut, as the published information for these companies is more readily available. Small chains and independent operators are also reviewed. <br /><br />As for fast foods, the focus in the snack foods segment concentrate on the dominate market operators of APD Snack Foods and Arnott&rsquo;s Snack Foods, as again, the information for these is easier to come by than the smaller firms in the market. <br /><br />The fast foods industry will continue to be dominated by the large chains, though opportunities still exist for the small operators to expand their presence in the market. <br /><br />The snack foods market will become even more concentrate than it is at present, as both APD and Arnott&rsquo;s continue to dictate market forces and strategies, establishing directions in the areas of products, customer service and retailing. <br /><br /> <br /><br />"

                            "This Research Report has three elements. The first involves a review of some of the theories of organisational participation. The second involves an examination of the factors determining the unique pattern of the development of employee participation and industrial democracy in Australia in general and in the Australian public sector in particular. The third involves an examination of the implementation of industrial democracy in the Australian Public Service and an appraisal of the factors likely to determine its future development. <br /><br />In a recent paper, Julian Teicher (1989) stated that although there has been a widespread tendancy to regard employee participation as having limited application in the public sector this has certainly not been the case in Australia. However, to my knowledge, at this point in time, there has not been any examination of the success of Australia\'s first experiment with a legislatively based scheme of industrial democracy such as that introduced in the Australian Public Service. <br /><br />Although this Research Report focuses on the Australian Public Service experience, it tries to place this firmly within the context of organisational participation theory and the application of employee participation and industrial democracy in Australia. For this reason considerable attention was given, in the early sections of the Report, to the theory and its application in the Australian context. <br /><br />The analysis of the implementation of industrial democracy in the Australian Public Service reveals a number of weaknesses which appear likely to frustrate the achievement of the Government\'s policy and its objectives. Some of this is directly due to the Goverment\'s own actions. Nonetheless, I think it is possible to conclude that the experiment has been a partial success. What remains to be determined is whether the gains of the last four years will be sustained, and whether appropriate participation by all staff will eventually become an integral part of Australian Public Service administration, or whether it will merely become part of its unique industrial relations system. <br /><br />"

                            "Life Insurance Companies in Australia control assets valued in excess of $24 billion. Each year they are responsible for the investment of $3,307 million of total premiums received and make payments to policy-owners and beneficiaries amounting to $2,345 million. Given these figures and the impact that Life Insurance Companies have on the Australian economy, the lack of research concerning the marketing strategies used by the industry is surprising. <br /><br />The objective of this paper is to research the changing patterns of distribution of life insurance in Australia in order to arrive at a recommended model for distribution channels to be used in medium sized companies. Because of the lack of literature in this particular area, it was necessary to initially examine the research and writings concerning the marketing of services generally.<br /> <br />This review ascertained that there are two approaches proposed for the marketing of services. The first maintains that there should be no difference in the marketing strategies between goods and services. The second approach argues that there are characteristics of services which set them apart from goods and create the need for a separate marketing strategy. As a result of the research, the paper argues for the second approach and examines the characteristics of services in order to lay down certain guidelines for their distribution.<br /><br />The second part of the paper looks at factors affecting the distribution of services generally and supports the view that the channels of distribution concept applied to goods is not necessarily applicable to services. The paper then examines the distribution of life insurance in Australia and includes an overview of the events of the past ten years which have had an important impact on the methods used. A Table is presented showing the distribution systems used by each of the 42 Life Insurance companies in Australia. The information was gained from personal interviews or telephone contact with all companies and shows that Companies in Australia can be divided into four groups as a result of their distribution strategy. The paper advances the hypothesis that there is a difference between the distribution strategies open to the industry as a whole and the systems available to an individual company. It is proposed that life insurance can only be distributed using the sales force agency system on direct response marketing. Individual companies however have a variety of choices within each system.<br /><br /> The third part of the paper examines each of these possible choices in detail. Several theories are advanced concerning the future of the agency distribution system. These theories are supported where possible by use of statistics provided by the Life Insurance Commissioner and by research carried out in the united States and Canada. The effect of the recently proclaimed Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984 is studied and the possible ramifications of this Act on the agency distribution system is examined. The potential of direct marketing - particularly where the market can be segmented - and its disadvantages, are discussed. The paper supports the use of direct response marketing but argues for the integration of this strategy with the use of any agency force. The growing use of extra - corporate entities as additional channels of distribution is examined and the potential for growth from this area is highlighted. The possibility of the distribution of life insurance through electronic merchandising is also discussed and particular emphasis is placed on Telecom\'s new national videotex service known as &quot;VIATEL&quot; as a logical area for Life Companies to investigate. <br /><br />In the final section of the paper, an analysis of market share movements for companies who have been using different distribution strategies is presented. This table shows the falling market share of those Companies which have employed sole agency systems only and the increasing market share of companies who have used other methods, either instead of a sole agency force, or to support it. An examination of the strengths, weaknesses, threats and opportunities of each method is presented and in conclusion, a recommendation for a distribution strategy to be used in medium size Life Companies is made. <br /><br />This recommendation argues for maintenance of the sole agency system in order to ensure continued recruitment of new agents into the system. However, companies should also strive to come to an agreement with extra - corporate entities, registered life brokers and selected multi-agents who have a specific target marketing strategy. Direct response strategies should be employed both for direct sale to consumers and to provide leads for the sole agency system. Electronic merchandising of life insurance is an area that needs to be further explored. <br /><br />"

                            "In recent times the role of the Director of Nursing in Queensland public hospitals has been undergoing rapid changes. This report examines these changes and the major forces driving them. The prime objective of this examination is to provide a basis for increasing understanding of the possible future of directors of nursing within the Queensland public health sector.<br /><br />Using predominantly archival data, the report initially reviews the historical struggle between senior nurse administrators and the medical profession, from the late nineteenth century until the 1970s. The report then utilises interviews conducted with a small sample of nurse executives in order to explore the subsequent move from hospital- based nurse training to the tertiary sector, and changes to nursing career structures as they impacted on directors of nursing. An analysis of these role transitions was made using theories of professionalisation. The trends reported were further evaluated within the context of recent changes in the health care system. This provided a foundation for critically examining the future role of directors of nursing. <br /><br />The report found that, traditionally senior nurse administrators formerly known as matrons, displayed sound managerial skills and had a reputation for cost-effective care. More recently, an increasing professionalism trend, in the 1980s, impacted on director of nursing roles, and enhanced the potential use of managerial competencies. Most recently, however, health system reforms such as regionalisation and subsequent cost containment, have effectively disempowered these positions, and constrained their potential. <br /><br />The report concludes that in order for the generic and clinical management skills of nurse executives to be fully realised, true decentralisation of economic control needs to occur. At this stage, however, devolvement of this responsibility is far from a reality. It is imperative, therefore, as key leaders of the nursing profession, that directors of nursing take strategic steps to control their own destiny, thus providing a legacy for the future of the profession. <br /><br />One such direction would be for a leadership role to be exercised in exploring and evaluating options arising from the movement towards clinical &lsquo;directorates&rsquo; thus ensuring empowerment of the next generation of directors of nursing. An equally enterprising move would be for directors of nursing to pursue strategic level role expansion into areas which contribute directly to patient care, while maintaining a balance of cost and quality. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"

Changes to industrial relations policy have linked these mechanisms to wage determination. <br /><br />This report studies the implementation of this policy in the service sector. The Queensland school system provides a more specific focus. <br /><br />Literature research provides information about background issues and key elements of the topic. The report moves through the broader industrial relations issues, to service industries, and finally focuses on specific schools. <br /><br />A case study approach is undertaken to investigate the response to enterprise bargaining and productivity measurement in school systems. The information was collected by an interview process with a number of stakeholders involved in the education enterprises and the enterprise bargaining processes. <br /><br />This report seeks to identify the current status of the implementation of enterprise bargaining in school systems. It also provides an indication of the complexity of the issues confronting those involved in the negotiations. By selecting indicators to develop a productivity measure and applying them to the chosen schools, a current \'snapshot\' is achieved. <br /><br />The report concludes that the considerable difficulties of establishing productivity measurement in education will have a negative effect on wages increases, the workforce and, by association, productivity itself. <br /><br />"

A perennial concern of the University of the South Pacific Extension Service arising from these factors is the quality of service provided to students at its regional centres. <br /><br />Although resources and money may not be plentiful, quality of service to students can still be greatly improved. Extension student numbers are declining throughout the South Pacific region (with the exception of Fiji). No one reason can be attributed to the drop in numbers. However, one important contributing factor is the quality of the service provided. This issue needs to become a major focus of managing Regional Study Centres. <br /><br />"

                            "A review of the literature, from 1990 indicates that several researchers agree with the basic procedures required for successful design and implementation of incentive schemes. However, the literature does not record any qualitative research investigating whether the application of these factors will produce a successful scheme in practice. <br /><br />In an endeavour to answer this question, two large organisations that have established team based incentive programs in the Brisbane area were investigated. In-depth interviews of their management and focus group discussions with their employees were conducted. Both organisations applied the design and implementation procedures in conformity with the literature methods. The outcomes were very different: One organisation has been running a successful scheme for nine years, and the other will be disbanded after three years. <br /><br />It is therefore possible to conclude there are other factors involved with the success of an incentive scheme other than design and implementation. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"

                            "The large number of small businesses in Australia must make a significant contribution to the Australian economy. Statistics show that a high proportion of small businesses fail within their first two years. The most common reason given for small business failure is poor management. <br /><br />Evidence suggests that a positive relationship exists between business planning and small business performance. Therefore, one way of improving small business performance and thus survival is through the use of business planning as a part of small business management. This research report aimed to investigate the value of business planning as a management tool for small businesses. The report achieved this by examining the literature regarding the following concepts: small business, business planning, value, management tool, formulation and formalisation. To provide some comparisons, case studies were conducted according to a case study protocol to facilitate future replication of this exploratory research. Individual, semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were conducted with two small business owners. <br /><br />Although the findings of the exploratory research cannot be generalised, the empirical results of this report corresponded with the findings of the literature review. Results suggest that the process of business planning is of more benefit than the plan itself. It seems that business planning is an evolving process requiring the commitment of the small business owner and of those that will implement the plans. It is mainly the small business owner that formulates the business plans. Outsiders sometimes supplement the planning effort. Effective business plans can be written or unwritten depending on the situation. Business planning can be useful in guiding the direction that a small business owner will take and can help in decision making. <br /><br />Thus it can be seen that business planning is valuable as a management tool for small businesses. <br /><br />"

                            "The introduction of unleaded petrol in Australia in July 1985 was a necessary element of an overall long term national strategy to control motor vehicle pollution and to prevent serious adverse consequences for public health and the environment. The reasons behind this controversial decision are examined along with its impact on those parties involved, but with particular emphasis on the petroleum refining industry. <br /><br />The need for unleaded petrol was not only to reduce lead emissions to the atmosphere but also \'to reduce other noxious vehicle exhaust emissions that are considered a potential health and environmental problem. The latter emissions are controlled by means of a catalytic converter installed in the exhaust system with unleaded petrol required because of the poisoning effect of lead on the catalyst, rendering it ineffective. <br /><br />The subject of lead in the environment and especially lead in petrol continues to raise issues of uncertainty and risk, with certain aspects of these explored in this paper. Lead is added to petrol by refiners because it is the lowest cost method of boosting octane levels in order to reduce knock in spark ignition engines. The alternatives to lead addition are more expensive octane enhancing compounds or more severe refinery processing which involves the use of significant additional energy as well as decreasing the yield of gasoline from crude oil consumed. <br /><br />This paper draws attention to the variety and complexity of the effects that the unleaded petrol legislation has on the refining industry. There will be increased pressure on octane upgrading processes which will require additional refinery capital investment. The processing options available for octane enhancement are discussed with the choice depending on economics and process unit availability, i.e. the selection of options is refinery specific. To illustrate the magnitude of costs involved in this choice, an economic analysis of processing options available for an existing refinery is presented as a case study. <br /><br />It can be concluded that the introduction of unleaded petrol was a much needed move towards the elimination of a potential health hazard which should benefit society as a whole now as well as for future generations. Since there is limited evidence that these emission controls have caused an improvement in city air quality, it is recommended that a post audit be carried out in the years to come. This will determine the actual benefit in economic terms of the investment of community financial resources in unleaded petrol and catalytic converters. <br /><br />"

                            "The application of portfolio performance measures to ethical mutual funds has elucidated the impact of socially responsible criteria on portfolio diversification and performance. <br /><br />The data used in this study consists of 116 fortnightly returns for six ethical mutual funds in the United States over the period 10 January 1985 to 8 June 1989. <br /><br />The ethical mutual fund performances were evaluated using both non-risk-adjusted and risk-adjusted performance measures. Tests were also conducted to identify and separate the contribution of stock selectivity and market timing to portfolio performance. <br /><br />The use of socially responsible criteria did not appear to narrow the available investment universe to the detriment of portfolio diversification. Funds with poor diversification were probably the result of management discretion rather than an outcome of a restricted investment universe. <br /><br />The results of risk-adjusted performance were similar to the findings of previous researchers. The mutual funds did not exhibit consistent superior performance. The mutual fund managers were unable to forecast the market or gain abnormal returns through stock selectivity. On average, the mutual funds were unable to earn positive abnormal returns. <br /><br />Comparison of ethical mutual funds with the average mutual fund is required before the impact of socially responsible criteria on portfolio diversification and performance can be fully resolved. <br />"

                            "The non residential building and engineering construction industry has experienced significant changes over the last two decades. These changes have affected both the private and public sector enterprises as customers and the construction firms. The changes can be attributed to macro and micro environmental factors. The needs of customers change. The construction firm has to develop both strategic and marketing strategies to satisfy such needs and at the same time also meet its organisational goals. This research report investigates the concept of strategic marketing as a process in which construction firms can adequately formulate and select strategies to meet and satisfy the changing needs of customers in a proactive way. It considers the use of the different project delivery systems as project strategies in the strategic marketing process. <br /><br />The report consists of literature search on the concept of strategic marketing and the generic competitive strategies. The report follows the strategic marketing process model construct as a means to identify the significant impact of macro and micro environmental effects on the construction industry and the consequent marketing strategy formulation and strategy selection. A questionnaire survey was used to conduct a search on the utilisation trend of the different delivery systems and the cause for such trend. This is to correlate and interprete the use of different delivery systems with strategic market changes. The interpretation is provided in both strategic and marketing terms. <br /><br />The report draws conclusions and recommendations about the construction firms need for strategic marketing process in order to market and compete proactively. The research also conclude about the strategic application and the strengths and weaknesesses of the different delivery systems. <br /><br />"

                            "Singapore is now an &quot;advanced economy&quot; along with the world\'s top countries like the United States and Japan, according to the International Monetary Fund\'s (IMF) latest semi-annual publication World Economic Outlook. Singapore is always cited as part of the &quot;Asian Miracle&quot; due to the fact that Singapore only takes thirty years to develop the &quot;advanced economy&quot;. However the path is not straight forward, Singapore has passed through three different stages of economic development namely entrep6t trading, industrialisation and value-added production. <br /><br />Singapore government plays an active and important role in the economy. Its interventionist economy policy heavily contributes to its astonishing growth since its independence in 1965. Now the government is focusing on enhancing infrastructures such as the nation-wide broadband telecommunication network and the 4-tier road system. <br /><br />While Singapore economy is performing well, some growth theorists, notably Alwyn Young and Paul Krugman, warned that Singapore\'s growth would not sustain because it is based on mobilisation of resources rather than improvement in efficiency. However, there are other economists such as Bernhard Eschweiler and Rachel van Elkan believed that the outlook of Singapore is bright if total factor productivity factors are managed well. <br /><br />The diverse perspectives of various growth theories are results of different assessment of total factor productivity (TFP) which is a measure of improvement in efficiency or productivity. The difference in assessment of TFP performance arises as a result of different definition of TFP, different methodologies employed and assumptions used, different data sets, and different period of time measured. Although different growth theories have different assessment of Singapore\'s outlook, all of them believe that TFP is essential for sustaining long-term economic growth. <br /><br />It implies that Singapore should develop an environment to foster TFP growth in order to achieve long-term economic growth. The endogenous growth theory by Paul Romer emphasises the role of human capital in sustaining economic growth. According to his theory, formal education and on-the-job training are essential to economic growth, this coincides with the other theories in the sense that education and training are means of enhancing TFP. <br /><br />The relationship of saving and economic performance is also reviewed. Neo-classical growth model states that high saving rate will increase the level of steady state per capita capital and per capita output. <br /><br />These studies suggest that TFP should play an increasing role in economic growth because increases in factors of production are subjected to the law of diminishing returns of inputs. However, Singapore has a disadvantage: as Singapore approaches the world technology frontier, its opportunities of technology catch-up and its potential for further TFP growth from this source are exhausted. <br /><br />While there has been heavily investment in human capital in Singapore through formal education and on-the-job training, a significant gap in educational attainment remains to be closed between Singapore and the industrial world. In addition, experience in number of other countries suggests that reducing distortions in the economy may serve to increase a country\'s TFP growth rate permanently by generating dynamic gains in efficiency. <br /><br />"

                            "This Research Report addresses the role leading into the 21st Century for national trade and investment facilitation organisations such as Department of Foreign Affairs &amp; Trade (DFAT)/Austrade in the context of what has been dubbed the &quot;Pacific Century&quot;. It seeks to evaluate the processes by which a country like Australia develops its strategic trade policy responses and practical export promotion programs, and if they are commensurate with the offerings of our competitors. <br /><br />The research approach adopted is a literature review of the subject areas of national trade policy development, trade promotion programs usually applicable at the national industry level and the more targeted export promotion programs directed at individual active and potential exporters. A &quot;networking information&quot; perspective is used to link the three areas of literature research derived from a model of &ldquo;exporter needs&quot; and recent research by Austrade of segments of its client database. <br /><br />The Research Report concludes that through the on-going development within Austrade of a systematised solution called the Export Opportunities System (EOS) that &quot;networking information&rdquo; is a significant incremental step in the development of a &ldquo;networking&rdquo; culture in Australian industry. Through relevant examples, it shows how such an approach can already provide a wealth of data for the modelling and analysis of Australia&rsquo;s strategic trade policy responses, appropriate trade promotion programs for addressing industry development needs, and a tailoring of export promotion programs to better address the needs of individual Australian exporters.<br />"

                            "Ever since China adopted its open door policy in the late-1970&rsquo;s, the nation&rsquo;s economic development has since become a major focal point in the international arena, in particular in the Asia-Pacific region.<br /><br />In order to appreciate China&rsquo;s current economic policies, it is necessary to know the historical settings since the formation of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China in 1949. This report begins by examining the ideologies that shaped the Chinese economy over the last four decades, and then considers the future prospects of the Chinese economy.<br /><br />Deng Viao-ping was and still is the most influential and prominent leader in China. The ten years of reforms (1979-1989) since Deng came back in to power had brought about both positive and negative effects. The negative effects appeared to have the demand for improving economic conditions in the years of soaring inflation into a pro-democracy movement.<br /><br />Coincident with the reform process was the rapidly changing external environment. In this technological era, the demand for democracy soon spreaded to the then former German Democratic Republic and then the whole Eastern Europe. This brought about the downfall of communist regimes, including the sudden disintegration of the Soviet Union into Commonwealth of Independent States.<br /><br /> And it appears that the Chinese leaders too are bending on resisting the peaceful evolution and the world trend in the decline of communism. Deng realizes that it is important to differentiate Chinese communism from the dying communism. Elsewhere, he has called Chinese communism &ldquo;Socialism with Chinese characteristics&rdquo;.<br /><br />Through studying the Chinese economy in the past and the present economic policy, it is possible to draw out very different scenarios. The particular areas that are being identified as central to the future direction of China&rsquo;s economic development include:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; A pessimistic view that China might become fragmented and divided if regional and structural imbalance, and/or income inequality between coastal and inland region cannot be corrected.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; A more optimistic view that secular change will prevail and add more capitalistic ingredients into so-called: Socialism with Chinese characteristic: like the case of Guangdong in recent years. This will undermine much of what remains of the command economy.<br />"

                            "The report is an analysis and evaluation of Australian petroleum exploration policy in the national interest. Broad policy objectives are defined after consideration of world petroleum supply, demand and reserves. It is concluded that while Australia is currently self-sufficient in petroleum, it is likely to become substantially reliant on petroleum imports in the early 1990\'s and almost totally dependent on imports by the year 2000. World petroleum supplies are expected to last well into the next century and the supply of Australia\'s import needs up to that time is expected to be adequate.<br /><br />Australia\'s prospectivity for petroleum is also examined and it is concluded that undiscovered resources are likely to be off-shore and small by world standards yet capable of significantly reducing the need for petroleum imports. For this reason, Australia needs an efficient exploration industry, but must also develop strong export industries to pay for future petroleum imports.<br /><br />Efficiency is considered to require the freedom for market forces to allocate factors of production (capital, labour, etc.) to competing industries. It is also considered that the benefits of resource development which accrue to the Australian people must be maximised.<br /><br />A review of the current state of the petroleum exploration industry reveals a high degree of State and Federal government regulation, and a complex and inefficient system of secondary taxation. In particular, the Federal system of excise duty on crude oil is considered to be a major deterrent to marginal production and development. There is also scope for improving the availability of high risk exploration capital by encouraging the formation of drilling funds. It is considered that the Australian economy would benefit from a progressive and sizeable opening up of the industry to market forces.<br /><br />The most beneficial system of secondary taxation for future exploration is considered to be a resource rent tax with bonus bidding, however, retrospective application of such a system to existing production is not supported. The existence of both State and Federal constitutional rights with respect to petroleum resources is seen as a major barrier to achieving uniform, equitable and efficient taxation of the industry.<br />"

                            "Competition Policy has been a significant force in the development of the Australian Water industry throughout this present decade. The central hypothesis of the theory is that &quot;the engine which drives efficiency is free and open competition&quot; (Keating, 1992). However, characteristics of the Australian Water Industry may mean that such concepts of &quot;economic efficiency&quot; have limitations in their application. <br /><br />This paper attempts to examine the economic theory which underlies Competition policy and contrast this with contemporary business strategy ideologies to identify the limitations of the policy and possible alternatives for the development of the Australian Water Industry. The experience of the UK is reviewed to illustrate the application of the competing economic and business strategies in the transfer of Infrastructure assets from public to private providers.<br /><br />The report challenges the assumption of superiority of private provision of services over the existing system of public ownership and control. The research indicates that aspects of the Australian Water industry are presently operating at or close to &quot;best practice&quot; levels of comparative privatised firms, thus indicating that there may be limited scope for improvement through greater involvement of the private sector in the management or ownership within the Industry.<br /><br />The central finding of this report is that the essential nature of the Australian Water Industry in the attainment of the broader social and environmental policy objectives may mean that measurement of cost should not be the single or even best measure of &quot;efficiency&quot; (EPAC). Furthermore, the evidence supports the argument that privatisation of the Infrastructure would introduce a structure inappropriate to the monopoly status of the Water industry (Lynk).<br />"

An analysis of the organisation and its personnel management practices indicates a need for a human resource management strategy that incorporates a development appraisal program. Performance appraisal literature and the situation within the Public Service is reviewed in considering design and implementation issues. Task, structure and culture are identified as particularly important considerations. The actual program that has been put in place is analysed and evaluated.<br />"

                            "This paper conducts an evaluation on the China\'s economic growth in the past 15 years. It also reviews the implications of China\'s Open-door Policy. The final part of this paper identifies the potentials, problems and future prospects of China\'s economic growth and suggests the positive directions for China\'s economic development in coming decades.<br /><br />China\'s economic growth has been phenomenal after its Open-door Policy. In 1993, China has nearly achieved its economic targets which set for the end of this century in 1982. However, it is noteworthy that the progress of the Open-door Policy in the last 15 years has not followed a smooth path.<br /><br />China cumulates the experience of NICS and pursues the &quot;Pacific Asian Model&quot; for its economic development. It is a model where economic reform is prioritized over political freedoms and democracy. China\'s economic development strategy is to achieve a relatively steady economic growth with tangible economic results on the basis of balanced national growth. Most important, China has effected a change of policy of seclusion to the policy of opening to outside world. Foreign investment, borrowing and foreign trade are the striking features conducing to China\'s economic growth. <br /><br />China has become a &quot;market-facilitating&quot; state. However, decentralization has inadvertently given rise to localism and departmentalism. Since early 1990s, China has strived to develop a &quot;socialist market economy&quot;. Labour market relations and corruption have increasingly become the serious social issues after liberalization. <br /><br />China has great potential for future economic development. On the supply side, China possesses adequate minerals and other natural resources necessary for economic growth. Abundant land and manpower play an important role in the process of the China\'s economic growth. On the demand side, China has a high saving/GNP rate and continuous inflow of foreign investment. Most important, China has a very large population of 1.2 billion people which provides a huge domestic market for China\'s economic growth.<br /><br />Ideological obstacles, political instability, inflation, unemployment, inefficiencies of state enterprises and inadequacy of infrastructure are the impediments which would hinder the economic growth in China. The recent political and economic developments suggest that China would have a bright economic prospects in the coming decades.<br /><br />It is concluded that China has the abilities to create an epochal &quot;Chines Miracle&quot; in the coming decade if the country has: (i) to make further moves to a market-driven economy (ii) to work with other Asian Pacific countries to promote regional economic development; and (iii) to integrate its economy further deeper into global economy.<br />"

                            "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This study is an attempt to find out the consumer sentiment in Brisbane toward marketing practice by measuring consumer attitudes toward the four elements of the marketing mix. The measurement instrument used in this study was adopted from that of Gaski and Etzel\'s study (1986). One thousand questionnaires were mailed to randomly selected households in Brisbane. The final usable sample was 214. The sample was slightly skewed to older; married; higher educated; highly skilled and higher income group.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Results from the survey reinforced the reliability and validity of Gaski and Etzel\'s scale, the \'Index of Consumer Sentiment Toward Marketing\', They showed that product was highly correlated to the other three marketing elements: product, advertising and retailing/selling. In addition, they showed that retailing/selling had the greatest impact on consumer\'s satisfaction out of the four elements. It presented a valuable information to marketers i.e. if they wanted to increase consumer\'s satisfaction toward their products, emphasing more on retailing/selling would be the most effective way.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Results showed that consumers in Brisbane tended to have an unfavourable attitude toward marketing and especially to price. They considered prices of products too high. However, they appreciated good services provided by salesmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Results of the survey also showed that :-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Males tended to have a more favorable attitude toward marketing than females.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Singles tended to have a more favorable attitude toward marketing than married.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Households within the age range of 25 - 29 tended to have a more favorable attitude toward marketing than others.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. People with higher education tended to have a more favorable attitude toward marketing than others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. People with higher individual income and family income tended to have more favorable attitude toward price than others.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. People with the occupation of sales and personal services tended to have a more favorable attitude toward marketing than others.<br />"

Further, in certain cases, the policies can even be construed as promoting inefficiencies.<br />"

                            "During the period from February to July 1994, the Australian combustion engineering market was the subject of an extensive case study, designed to provide industry insights and to develop a marketing strategy for Hauck Manufacturing, a United States based company looking to re-establish their position in the global market. The other primary objectives of this report are the development of an appropriate research method for investigation of South East Asian markets for Hauck products, and appropriate methods of research for related combustion products in Australia.<br /><br />The research methodology utilised in this report is exploratory - a hybrid research design consisting of analysis of available secondary data, literature reviews and depth interviews. This method was selected due to the small size and resources of the Australian based representative, the limited degree to which the problem had already been investigated, and the limited amount of secondary data available. <br /><br />The theoretical basis of the report\'s industry study is the &quot;Structure-Conduct-Performance&quot; model, derived from industrial economic thought, and Michael Porter\'s Competitive Forces model. The development of strategy is based upon the current managerial paradigm of strategic marketing management. This includes analysis of market size and segments, customers, competitors, and external environmental factors.<br /><br />The major findings of these analyses were:<br /><br />&bull; That the Australian market is small, estimates decreasing in July 1993-May 1994 to 3376 units from the July 1992-June 1993 figure of 4752 units.<br /><br />&bull; The major markets geographically are based in Victoria and New South Wales.<br /><br />&bull; The major target segments identified were the Australian Asphalt, Heat Treatment and Mineral industries (Nickel, Aluminium. Copper, Lead and Zinc). <br /><br />&bull; Customer purchasing patterns were affected dramatically by external factors in the Asphalt and Mineral industries, such as government funding and commodity prices.<br /><br />&bull; The Heat Treatment industry is still using very outdated technology.<br /><br />&bull; Competitors within the combustion engineering industry are primarily overseas based producers, who are represented in Australia by combustion engineering firms. The necessary Research and Development carried out by these companies is not justified in Australia by the market returns. <br /><br />&bull; Economic recovery is likely to lead to increased investment in capital equipment by Australian based firms.<br /><br />&bull; The regulatory environment which has not made any significant impact on operations thus far is likely to change in respect of emission and noise levels.<br /><br />Key marketing issues identified were:<br /><br />&bull; The re-Iaunch of the Hauck products and brand name into the Australian market. This is necessary because no company has provided direct representation for Hauck in recent years, resulting in a loss of confidence in the brand name, as well as loss of virtually all market share to other competitors. <br /><br />&bull; The objective of the re-Iaunch is to overcome the poor reputation for service which remains from the previous representatives, and to introduce the new recently appointed representatives. <br /><br />&bull; Establishment of a local distribution network. Distributors are only based in New South Wales and Queensland. A more widespread distribution network allows easier access to customers outside of these areas. The primary objective to be achieved through distribution is to dramatically increase the contact with final users throughout the market, to pull the product through OEM\'s.<br /><br />&bull; Establishing the Price/Technology tradeoff. The objective is to adequately inform all potential new customers of the longer term benefits, through quantifying the value which is created by the products.<br /><br />&bull; Sales personnel. The objective of the sales force evaluation is to establish closer ties with existing and potential customers.<br /><br />&bull; Use of existing customers and contacts. The objective is to use as many referees as possible. Such information may have a powerful effect on customers, and is an invaluable promotional tool.<br /><br />&bull; Market Expansion through a long term view toward overseas market development. Market penetration is the only product based strategy available in Australia.<br /><br />The final strategy recommendations were:<br /><br />&bull; Customer focus. This entails close working relationships over the long term, analysis of customer purchasing patterns, analysis of customers\' market demand and growth, and formation of alliances with customers.<br /><br />&bull; Product positioning. It is necessary to determine the appropriate product range and positioning using pricing and promotional strategies in the short term, as the customer focus strategy will require long term implementation.<br /><br />&bull; Structuring for manufacturing. Despite a few potential problems, manufacturing under license is more attractive, at least for the regularly supplied products which would provide rapid payback on investment.<br /><br />&bull; Related diversification. This strategy becomes evident by analysing the very high level of value added to the core Hauck products. Such manufactured products sold for a major project are worth probably $100,000 - $200,000, but with the knowledge which is marketed in the form of mineral extraction technology, the various ancillary equipment (which is outsourced), spare parts, installation and supervision, invariably project value will be increased to millions of dollars.<br /><br />&bull; Service strategy. The emphasis of the service strategy is on maintenance of installations to optimise efficiency of operation. The long term approach entails fixed price contracts and service guarantees. In addition, internal marketing to sales staff and engineering is vital in implementing service strategy.<br /><br />&bull; Feedback, monitoring and control. Customer feedback forms the basis of monitoring and control, and offers an indication of the level of success of strategies such as product pricing and positioning. In addition, on an ongoing basis, evaluation by engineers of the standards produced by network manufacturing partners is critical.<br />"

                            "<i>Objectives</i><br />This report is an industry study that has aimed to set out in a logical manner the major influences and participants that are pertinent to the Australian cement industry both in the past and in the future. The report will also canvass major industry changes on a global scale to determine the likely effect these will have on the Australian industry. <br /><br /><i>Major areas to be covered include : </i><br />o The influence of technology and scale on the industry. <br />o The interaction between the cement market and the structure of the industry. <br />o The source of cement demand and the nature of this demand. <br />o Performance of the industry in financial and productivity terms. <br />o The interaction between industry participants, the Government and consumers. <br /><br /><i>Scope </i><br />The scope of this report is restricted to the milieu of those organisations who manufacture cement clinker and grind this clinker to cement. Included in this milieu are the importers of cement and the parent companies of those cement companies which are subsidiaries of other organisations. <br /><br /><i>Method </i><br />The first step was to build an overall view of, the cement industry, by listing the industry participants and the outlining the scope of the industry. The recently published report by the Bureau of Industry Economics (BIE) enabled a quick understanding of the dynamics of the industry to be gained. <br /><br />From this point the important aspects of the industry were detailed and a wide ranging collation of information and data was carried out. This search included published data from industry bodies such as Cembureau and the Portland Cement Association, trade literature, company annual reports, stockbroker reports and statistical data. <br /><br />Field work has included visiting Victorian and NSW cement plants, interviews with management and works personnel together with discussion with representatives of the Cement and Cement Association and the State Rail Authority of NSW. <br /><br /><i>Results and Conclusions </i><br />The major results of this study highlight an industry that has already undergone substantial rationalisation and integration under the combined influences of improvements in technology and a maturing market. Backward integration by the cement companies is virtually complete, while substantial horizontal integration has taken place with the amalgamation of cement companies. The premix companies are a major influence on the industry and have moved to acquire cement companies largely as a defensive measure. <br /><br />The industry is currently experiencing a growth in import competition, albeit from a low base. This competition, plus the strategies being pursued by some cement companies, will lead to growing competition and ultimately further rationalisation such that there will be three or four cement plants in Australia of world scale. <br /><br />"

                            "After decades of self-isolation from the outside world, the Chinese leadership officially announced the &quot;open door&quot; policy in late-1978. In line with this policy, China adopted a strategy to use private foreign capital to spur economic development. During the 1980s, foreign direct investment (FDI) was actively pursued by China. <br /><br />There is considerable controversy about the relative costs and benefits of FDI to developing countries. Ever since China opened the economy to FDI, the nation\'s ability to reap the benefits and avoid the negative results of FDI has become a major focal point in the international arena, especially in Communist/Pro-communist countries. China\'s experience in absorbing FDI has important implications for other Communist/Pro-communist countries, and can help predicting what is likely to happen in these countries if similar policy is adopted.<br /><br />The goals of this report are to review the pattern of FDI in China during the 1980s, study its nature, evaluate its impact on the Chinese economy, predict the likely future development of FDI in China and examine the implications of China\'s experience to other Communist/Pro-communist countries. <br /><br />It is difficult to see the first ten years of China\'s foreign investment policy as anything other than a resounding economic success. The Chinese goals of increased exports, capital inflows, improved management skill and technology transfer have been met, although not exactly as China\'s policy makers intended. Base on the analysis of the major factors influencing China\'s policy, it is expected that China will continue to open her economy to foreign investment. <br /><br />China has her unique strengths to reap the benefits of FDI and control its negative results. The apparent success of China\'s foreign investment policy in terms of attracting and controlling FDI will encourage other Communist/Pro-communist governments to try to emulate them. However, given the unique nature of the economic and political environment in China, it is unlikely that the same policy can be applied successfully in other Communist/Pro-communist countries. <br /><br />"

                            "&quot;The factory of the future&quot; has become a popular topic in everyday conversation and many computerized technologies are now available for future implementation of this development. Computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM) , represents an integration of all the relevant manufacturing activities and could be regarded as a blue print for the factory of the future. <br /><br />However, building a computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM) system is difficult and the following questions needed to be addressed: <br />What technologies are to be employed? <br />What hardware and software standards are to be used? <br />How to plan a CIM implementation? <br />What strategies should organizations adopt? <br />There are also concerns about effective use of the CIM. This paper will discuss the CIM concept and framework, and provide some strategies for the implementation of the CIM. The paper is organized as follows: <br /><br /><b>Chapter 1. Introduction </b><br />The aim of this chapter is to describe the evolution of the computer applications in manufacturing and the CIM market environment. <br /><br /><b>Chapter 2. Model of the CIM technology </b><br />This chapter defines the CIM model, architecture and classifies ClM components and prototypes. <br /><br /><b>Chapter 3. Other functions related to CIM </b><br /><br /><b>Chapter 4. Planning for CIM implementation </b><br />This chapter discusses mainly the planning process for the CIM implementation. <br /><br /><b>Chapter 5. Management strategy</b><br />This chapter aims to depict the management problems and strategy. <br /><br /><b>Chapter 6. CIM assessment </b><br />The emphasis of this chapter is to assess the efficiency of the CIM in terms of technical and economic aspects. <br /><br /><b>Chapter 7. Conclusion </b><br />The conclusion looks at the future development of the CIM. <br /><br />"

                            "Debate exists among labour economists over whether education\'s economic role consists of augmenting human capital or screening workers for existing abilities. The significance of this question lies in the fact that it examines whether there exists overprovision of education in society and whether current levels of public education funding are justified. Examination of the ongoing controversy between the human capital and screening theories of education involves the utilisation of a number of empirical models and tests. The findings of this thesis indicate that, from an analysis of the pattern of Australian school enrolments following increased state minimum school leaving ages, there exists no supporting evidence for the screening hypothesis of education. The human capital approach to education is supported both by theoretical and empirical consistency. As a result education is found to play an important role in equipping labour with productive skills demanded by employers in the Australian labour market. <br />"

                            "This thesis examines accounting for investments in associates. It addresses the following research issues: do corporate joint ventures possess economic characteristics distinct from other associated companies and, if so, do these economic attributes predict valuation policy, namely cost or revaluation of the investment in associates. <br /><br />The study draws on transactions cost explanations, informed by monitoring incentives developed in the agency literature, to provide the framework to explore organisational arrangements for associated companies and accounting policy choice. Differences in the governance structures of corporate joint ventures and other associates are used to explain operating and financing characteristics and the valuation policy adopted for investments in associates. <br /><br />The contract that distinguishes corporate joint ventures from other associates is the shareholders\' agreement governing the conduct and operation of the venture. Corporate joint ventures are likely to be integrated operationally and financially with the investor because the conditions which provide incentives for such governance mechanisms are those which imply non-arm\'s length transactions between investor and investee. Interdependencies are therefore expected to reflect governance structures. In tum, interdependencies provide an incentive to adopt accounting policies that mitigate opportunism between related parties. Accounting policy for valuation of associates is expected to be endogenously determined with other aspects of the governance structure. <br /><br />The results indicate that corporate joint ventures differ systematically from other associates. Strong empirical support for intra-group differences in operating interdependence is provided. Corporate joint ventures are more likely to trade with their investors than other associates, and this is observed for both purchases and sales. With respect to financing interdependence, the results show that corporate joint ventures are more likely to have guarantees, use short-term investor financing and retain higher levels of profits relative to other associates. <br /><br />Contrary to predictions, non-current financing and leverage are not supported in multivariate testing. The absence of a relationship for non-current investor financing is consistent with the permissible alternative contained in the precedent shareholders\' agreement, that is, the use of external borrowings supported by investor guarantees. Furthermore, there is no incremental explanatory power in leverage after controlling for specific forms of financing, viz. guarantees, investor loans and retained profits. <br /><br />Examination of the accounting policy choice, whether to revalue investments in associates, reveals that, after controlling for leverage and the materiality of the investment in associates, the larger the investment in corporate joint ventures as a proportion of the investment in associates the more likely is revaluation. In an alternative specification of the independent variable that substitutes operating and financing characteristics for governance structure, the results show that a higher volume of purchases by investees reduces the likelihood of revaluation. As the only discriminating variable, it is supportive of an efficiency explanation of valuation policy in circumstances likely to generate unrealised profits from related party transactions. <br />"

                            "This research has been a first attempt to establish a relationship between goals (and goal setting) at the organisation wide level and organisational performance in the Australian banking industry. Data was obtained on 16 banks through structured interviews and content analysis of annual reports from 1987 to 1991. In addition to financial performance, this study examined the areas of business, customers, shareholders, staff, and society, where organisation wide goals had been established. Important insight was provided into the overall goals themselves and the way they affected goal setting and activity at lower levels of the organisation. Banks were found to pursue multiple goals that appeared to form a consistent hierarchy of importance, with profit considerations often seen as the most important goal. Work units worked towards their own goals, which were not necessarily set in line with the overall ones. It was also found, that banks with below median financial performance were more likely to have changed their organisation wide goals than the better performing banks. The major conclusion was that sustained, above median, financial performance was positively related to success in striving towards set overall goals. <br />"

This thesis attempts to provide some understanding about this entrepreneurial group of small businessmen.<br /><br />The study was made with Chinese owners and/or managers as well as professionals. 35 people were interviewed in the Brisbane and Gold Coast areas. The instrument consisted of a four part questionnaire a. personal profile, management style, personal values, managerial practices. <br /><br />The results indicate that a large proportion were not born in Australia, are self-employed predominantly in the restaurant business and are generally high--income earners. They tend to be authoritian in their managerial style, they place a high importance on interpersonal relations, value achievement and success, practice close supervision of subordinate\'s and are usually nepotistic and paterncilistic. This is probably due to the size of their firms which are genera11y small, employing almost invariably less than 20 people. <br /><br />As an exploratory study, this the.sis suggests that continuing research should be made to establish more definitively the impact of ethnic minority culture on managerial practices, and. the level of integration of this increasingly important group of entrepreneurs into mainstream Australian business. It follows that cross-national comparisons would also highten our understanding of these issues. <br /><br />"

                            "Computers are having a rapidly growing impact on business. One of the results of this is an emerging need for fault tolerance in some of these computers. <br /><br />Very basically, fault tolerance means the ability to detect and survive a computer fault and continue processing. <br /><br />The objectives of this report are to:- <br />1 .Discuss the relevance of computer fault tolerance to business. <br />2.To investigate whether there are differences between Australian industries in their perceived importance of fault to tolerance to their companies&rsquo; computer policies. (To be clone by survey.) <br /><br />The report will have the following format:- <br />1.Consider the current relevance of computer fault tolerance to business. <br />2.Describe applications of &quot;fault tolerant&quot; computers. <br />3.Discuss the theoretical basis of fault tolerant techniques. <br />4.Provide examples of commercial systems available in Australia. <br />5.Present and discuss the survey and its results. <br /><br />Fault tolerance is not a single quantum that is either present or absent in a computer. Rather, it consists of a plethora of techniques which can be used to improve computer reliability. <br /><br />Fault tolerant techniques can be used to counter the problems of computer vulnerability but they are not sufficient alone. Other techniques are also applicable, for example, offsite data storage. <br /><br />The survey did show a trend towards differences in various industries\' perceptions of their needs for computer fault tolerance in their computer systems - the Banking/Finance and Chemical Products Industries respondents felt that this issue was more important than the other industries\' respondents. <br /><br />There was also a trend towards other differences between the industries surveyed. These will be presented in Chapter 6. <br /><br />Many of the respondents volunteered comments in the space provided for this. These comments were interesting and gave some insights into the respondents\' opinions regarding fault tolerance and its relevance to both their companies and business in general. <br /><br />"
